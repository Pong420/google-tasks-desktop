#### [Download](https://github.com/Pong420/google-tasks-desktop/releases)

#### :warning: You will need to enable your own [Google Tasks API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/tasks.googleapis.com) whether you are user or developer.

#### Step to enable Google Tasks API.

1. Setup your [OAuth consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) in Google API Console

2. In Google API Console [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) section.
   Create credentials => OAuth client ID => Other => Create. After, you should get a json file like this.

```json
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "project_id": "...",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "redirect_uris": ["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob", "http://localhost"]
  }
}
```

3. Start and drag this file into the application.

4. Click on `Get Code` button then you will require authentication. Just ignore the `This app isn't verified` warning and continue because you are the app owner.

5. Paste the code into the input filed and click confirm. Done!
