### Project Setup

1. Enable your own [Google Task API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/tasks.googleapis.com)

2. Setup your [OAuth consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) in Google API Console

3. In Google API Console [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) section.
   Create credentials => OAuth client ID => Other => Create. After, you should get a json file like this.

```json
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "project_id": "...",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "redirect_uris": ["urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob", "http://localhost"]
  }
}
```

### Development

```
yarn dev
```

To package apps for the local platform:

```
yarn package
```

First, refer to the [Multi Platform Build docs](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies. Then,

### Known issue

- The tasks that marked as completed through the official platform (Web/App) will not show in this application
- Add time is not supported as API limitation
- Once you add/edit the `date` through an official platform (Web/App). Then you change the `date` in this application, the `date` shown in the official platform (Web/App) will not be updated.
- For tasks sort by date
  - Move task up/down shortcut is not supported currently.
  - Tasks sorting order is not synced to the official platform (Web/App)
